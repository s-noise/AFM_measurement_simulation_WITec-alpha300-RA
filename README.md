# AFM_measurement_simulation_WITec-alpha300-RA
a python script for training and education purpose simulating an AFM measurement (session) of graphene on a WITec alpha300 RA device;

This small program can be used for training or education purpose, e.g. in the contaxt of an online practical class
Therefore, no initial guidance is given in the program itself and no "back" button is added for the individual steps during the simulated session.
The individual steps of the simulation, ~"slide by slide" are listed in the "instructions" file, visible after unzip
