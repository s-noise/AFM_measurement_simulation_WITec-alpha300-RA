# This small program can be used for training or education purpose, e.g. in the contaxt of an online practical class
# Therefore, no initial guidance is given in the program itself and no "back" button is added for the individual steps during the simulated session.
# The individual steps of the simulation, ~"slide by slide" are listed below:


open ControlFIVE

Configurations -> set AFM AC

Adjustment -> laser off

click z up with "up" button in Microscope Z (MZ) window

click z down

adjust brightness with y button on x-box controler

find focus (z button in MZ window) and set z value to 0 (MZ window)

find sample position with graphene sheet:
click arrow buttons in Sample Position (SP) window and set position to 0 (SP)
(1x right, 1x top)

click z up (MZ)

start adjustment

click cantilever "down" button in Cantilever (C) window

arrow buttons in C window (right or backward)

deactivate top illumination in Video Control (VC) window, right top "light bulb" button

open Illumination Settings in VC, right top "camera" button

deactivate Smart Exposure and Smart Gain
and set "sliders" for Exposure and Gain to maximum

arrow "forward" in C window

decrease Exposure and Gain
(both sliders to a point that is one higher than the point where the video screen goes black)

click "up" and "down" in C window to focus laser (highest brightness)

set "slider" Exposure and Gain to minimum
activate Smart Exposure and Gain

activate top illumination ("light bulb" button)

set Probe position in VC window to AFM tip

next alignment step

"z" down in MZ window

next alignment step

driving amplitude 0.1

driving amplitude increase 
(arrows in AFM status increase)
Amplitude value in Status window must be above 1.4 V
to be able to continue with "next"

setpoint between 1.1 and 1.5 -> continue "next"

tip appoach with button in top control (TC) menu

image scan:
set some values:
0s < Time/Line < 10s
4 < Points per Line (Image) < 512
0 < Width (Height)
Width, Height, Center X, Center Y : region must be inside 100x100 um^2 around tip
(region displayed in video screen)
-> start scan

survey scan -> new scan, new detailed region
(new region displayed in one signal image)

retract tip button in TC window

z "up" button in MZ window

finished
